## Introduction
Project name: Student-Corner
Institution: MSUDenver/DU
Date:10/22/2023

Student-Corner is a Flask web application designed as a submission to the 2023 Hack-A-Thon. Student-Corner is designed to incorporate ways to get students involved with school activities while doing the daily activity of getting food! Student-Corner does this by having reviews of local restaurants by students joined with student and school made events. 

## Requirements
Requiremnts given by the Hack-A-Thon was simply to improve campus life. We wrote down very minimally before starting and never had written requirements.Vocally we wanted to have users, restaurants, reviews, and events. We wished users to be able to create reviews and events. Users assigned as admins would be able to create restaurants.

## Required modules
During this project the following were used:
- Python 3.11.6
- Flask
- WTForms 
- SQLAlchemy 
- Jninja
- bcrypt

## Installation

First, clone the git repository. 
python 
```
git clone https://github.com/msu-denver/project-1-windoors-small-hydration.git
```
Next, create a virtual environment.

Finally, use the package manager [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages from the requirements file.
python
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You may need to set the Flask environment variable along with the secret key, which can be done by inputting the following into the terminal: 

```
$env:FLASK_APP = "app"
$env:SECRET_KEY= 'secret key'
